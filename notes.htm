Towards using a .rewards config file
<br />
at the root of the repository with any mappings for author -&gt; address;
<br />
signed using bitcoin's message signing.
<br />
Additionally; that commit could be signed by gpg to verify the GPG key too.
<br />
<br />
Most currencies IIRC use ECDSA which means that
<br />
they need to use multiple signatures to implement that;
<br />
whereas ripple and few others use EdDSA and may perform a true distributed signature (t, n) schnoor sig.
<br />
<br />
It's bad enough to integrate into a protocol like git, with optional pgp signatures.
<br />
auditory of web is more broad, so gateway is necessary
<br />
<br />
smart contracts could improve on this by defining the interface that the bot invokes.
<br />
Such a contract could limit the max pay out per some time period. I.e. 500 tokens per hour
